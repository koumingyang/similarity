Supervised object detection and semantic segmentation require object or even pixel level annotations. When there exist image level labels only, it is challenging for weakly supervised algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
The deficiency of segmentation labels is one of the main obstacles to semantic segmentation in the wild. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel framework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level class labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known to segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area.
We address the problem of image segmentation from natural language descriptions. Existing deep learning-based methods encode image representations based on the output of the last convolutional layer. One general issue is that the resulting image representation lacks multi-scale semantics, which are key components in advanced segmentation system.
