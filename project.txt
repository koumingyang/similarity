fully supervised methods for semantic segmentation require pixel-level class masks to train, the creation of which is expensive in terms of manual labour and time. In this work, we focus on weak supervision, developing a method for training a high-quality pixel-level classifier for semantic segmentation using only image-level class labels provided ground-truth as the.
The Normalized Cut (NCut) objective function, widely used in data clustering and image segmentation, quantifies the cost of graph partitioning in a way that biases clusters or segments that are balanced towards having lower vvalues than unbalanced partitionings.
